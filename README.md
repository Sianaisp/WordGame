# WordGame
A small game to test your language skills


_Time invested
Around 8 hours

_Time distribution
Concept and prototype drawing: 30mn
Creating Model and accessing data: 1 hour
Accessing and showing data on the view: 30mn
Game Play, setting new words and game logic: 2 hours
Creating and adjusting Animations 1 hour
UI Adjustments: 30mn
Unit Testing: 1.5 hour

_Decisions made
At first I used the json file but then decided to go with the URL to make irt more dynamic.
I initially started using an MVC pattern and changed it when I realised how big the controller was getting and for MVVM for easier testing.
I decided also to add some imageViews behind the words so the overlap would look better

_More time
I'd add a startup screen before the game starts
Better error handling,I would add a visual feedback on the screen if we were unable to reach the URL or get proper data
Make different levels with different speeds and colours
Adapt the cloud and plane sizes to the sizes of the words
Better animations and game play
Visual feedback/blinking when tapping the buttons and haptic feedback
Find a way to write better UNIT tests
